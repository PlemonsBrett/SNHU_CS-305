# Artemis Financial Vulnerability Assessment

## Client Summary and Software Requirements

Artemis Financial is a financial consulting company that specializes in developing individualized financial plans for their clients. The company handles sensitive financial data and required a comprehensive security assessment of their web application. As their financial services include international currency transactions, they needed robust security measures to protect client data, ensure compliance with financial regulations, and secure communications across their platform. The primary challenge was to identify and address potential vulnerabilities in their existing system that could compromise client financial data.

## Security Vulnerability Assessment Strengths

I conducted a thorough vulnerability assessment that followed the vulnerability assessment process flow. I'm particularly proud of the comprehensive approach I took, analyzing both the application architecture and specific vulnerabilities across multiple domains. By performing both manual code reviews and automated static testing, I was able to identify critical issues such as hardcoded credentials, input validation flaws, and outdated dependencies with known vulnerabilities.

Secure coding is essential because just one vulnerability can compromise an entire system and lead to data breaches, financial loss, and damaged reputation. For a financial company like Artemis Financial, software security directly impacts their ability to maintain client trust and comply with industry regulations. Strong security measures add value by protecting sensitive financial data, preventing unauthorized access, ensuring business continuity, and demonstrating a commitment to safeguarding client interests.

## Challenging and Helpful Parts of the Assessment

The most challenging aspect of the vulnerability assessment was thoroughly analyzing the codebase to identify security issues like SQL injection vulnerabilities and cryptographic weaknesses. This required deep technical knowledge and attention to detail. However, this manual review process was also incredibly valuable as it helped me understand the interconnected nature of security vulnerabilities.

The static testing using dependency checks was particularly helpful as it efficiently identified specific vulnerabilities in third-party libraries with clear remediation paths. For example, discovering the Log4j vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228) through automated scanning saved significant time and potentially prevented a serious security breach.

## Increasing Security Layers

I enhanced security by implementing multiple layers of protection:
1. Improved input validation to prevent injection attacks
2. Strengthened authentication and session management
3. Implemented proper cryptographic practices for sensitive data
4. Secured API endpoints with proper authentication
5. Enhanced error handling to prevent information leakage
6. Updated vulnerable dependencies to secure versions

In future assessments, I would use a combination of tools including OWASP ZAP for dynamic testing, OWASP Dependency-Check for dependency scanning, manual code reviews, and threat modeling techniques like STRIDE. I would also incorporate penetration testing to simulate real-world attacks and verify the effectiveness of security measures.

## Ensuring Functionality and Security

To maintain functionality while improving security, I followed a careful refactoring process. After implementing security improvements, I performed comprehensive regression testing to ensure all existing features still worked as expected. I also ran the application in a development environment to verify that security enhancements didn't introduce performance issues.

To check for new vulnerabilities after refactoring, I ran dependency checks again, performed code reviews of modified sections, and conducted additional testing focused on the refactored components. This multi-layered verification approach ensured that security improvements didn't inadvertently introduce new issues.

## Helpful Resources and Tools

Throughout this project, I relied on several valuable resources:
- The vulnerability assessment process flow diagram provided a structured approach to security analysis
- OWASP Top 10 for identifying common web application vulnerabilities
- OWASP Dependency-Check for identifying vulnerable dependencies
- National Vulnerability Database (NVD) for researching vulnerabilities
- Java Security Standard Algorithm Names for cryptographic recommendations
- Spring Framework security best practices

These resources provided invaluable guidance and will continue to be useful in future security assessments.

## Examples for Future Employers

From this assignment, I can showcase my ability to conduct comprehensive security assessments that balance technical security requirements with business needs. My vulnerability assessment report demonstrates methodical security analysis and practical mitigation strategies. I can show potential employers how I identified issues across multiple security domains, from input validation to cryptography, and provided clear, actionable recommendations.

The report also highlights my understanding of security standards and best practices in the financial sector, as well as my ability to prioritize vulnerabilities based on severity and business impact. This project effectively demonstrates both my technical security knowledge and my ability to communicate complex security concepts to stakeholders in a clear, organized manner.
